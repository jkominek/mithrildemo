This is a simple demo of making a single page app with Mithril,
without any of the npm/bower/whatever other fresh madness the
javascript community has decided to inflict on itself this week.

I don't know what I'm doing, but I do know that this is nicer than
trying to manually kludge the same thing together with jQuery and
a bunch of state management. If you've got any better/more concise
ideas how to do what is being done here, please let me know.

You can view it in action at https://hypercomplex.net/mithrildemo/

It attempts to simulate a login/logout mechanism, a database of
articles, and a search mechanism for those articles.

The look was roughly borrowed from Hacker News.
