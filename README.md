# What is this?

This is a simple demo of making a single page app with Mithril,
without any of the npm/bower/whatever other fresh madness the
javascript community has decided to inflict on itself today.

I don't know what I'm doing, but I do know that this is nicer than
trying to manually kludge the same thing together with jQuery and
a bunch of state management. If you've got any better/more concise
ideas how to do what is being done here, please let me know.

You can view it in action at https://hypercomplex.net/mithrildemo/

It attempts to simulate a login/logout mechanism, a database of
articles, and a search mechanism for those articles.

The look was roughly borrowed from Hacker News.

# What do I do with it?

Feel free to just copy this, and start hacking at it to get it to
do what you want. The goal wasn't to make a framework on top of a
framework; that's the last thing the web needs any more of.

Edit everything; throw stuff out; mix your code into what I've written.

Or just read it, laugh. Whatever gets you through the day.
